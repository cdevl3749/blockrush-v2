    "questions": [
      {
        "q": "How does BlockRush work?",
        "a": "BlockRush is a crowdfunding platform to purchase Bitcoin miners (Bitmain Antminer S19 XP). Each participant receives shares proportional to their investment and shares the mining rewards discovered."
      },
      {
        "q": "What are the risks?",
        "a": "Bitcoin mining offers no guaranteed returns. Block discovery is random. If the funding goal isn't reached, you get a 100% refund. Rewards depend on luck and Bitcoin network difficulty."
      },
      {
        "q": "How are rewards distributed?",
        "a": "If a Bitcoin block is discovered by our miners, the reward (currently 3.125 BTC + fees) is distributed proportionally among all participants according to their shares. Example: if you have 2% of shares, you receive 2% of the reward."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I withdraw my investment?",
        "a": "Before goal is reached: full refund possible. After miners are purchased: your investment is converted into mining shares. Future rewards will be paid to you in Bitcoin."
      },
      {
        "q": "How long does the project last?",
        "a": "Funding continues until reaching €25,000. Once the goal is reached, miners are installed within 14 days and run 24/7 to attempt discovering Bitcoin blocks."
      },
      {
        "q": "How to track performance?",
        "a": "You'll have access to a real-time dashboard showing: computing power, mining attempts, and all transactions. Total transparency guaranteed via blockchain."
